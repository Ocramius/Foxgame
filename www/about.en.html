<h5 class="page-header"><a id="content" name="content">¿Who makes Foxgame?</a></h5>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>I am the main programer of all of this, I am Ramiro Aparicio Gallardo and I am a coder from Madrid who plays OGame daily since a couple of years and that likes to code things like this in his spare time. 
I make a small amount of money from this (just from the ads in this web and the board) but obviously I can not live from that money, it allows me to pay my web server (Foxgame board, Spanish OWiki, Universe and Server updates) and have some drinks from time to time. 
</p>
<p>If you want to know more about me or how Foxgame was created at first instance, read this interview made a couple of months ago by a polish player (translated to english):</p>
<a href="http://board.ogame.org/thread.php?threadid=358114">http://board.ogame.org/thread.php?threadid=358114</a>
<p>
But all of this will be impossible without you, the players, currently more than 150.000 player that have Foxgame installed in their Firefoxes (you can see detailed stats at:
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/es-ES/statistics/addon/1766">Mozilla.org</a>
) and I just keep doing this just for you, becouse sometimes it is very difficult to get time to work in this but you keep asking for more, thanking the great job or just asking for a fix and I can not say no, so thank you all for the support. 
</p>
<p>
I must also thank all the people that helped to translate Foxgame to more than 25 languages (complete or parcially), and to help you I change the translation method so it should be easier for everyone just see <a href="translation.en.html">this info</a>.

I must also thank all the people that go to the board and help, gives new ideas, give support to others, report bugs or even gives some code to be included, so thank you goes also for you:
StalkR (who left OGame some time ago), Solar Angel (aka SA), Cezarica, Neo3000, laurenzo17, frantic, Gwenegan, mnemonic, Sheridan, Coup de Grace, jkazama...
Without all this people Foxgame would not be as it is now.
</p>
<p>
I can not forget all the mods, GOs, BAs... that helped Foxgame when it was the only Firefox extension for OGame and it was not so clear if it was legal or not.
I must also say thank you to GF the culprit of all of our lost time in this great game OGame. 
</p><p>
Finally I wanted to say thank you to the three courageus people that has donated so far, I will not say his names as I don't know if they want to remain anonimous or not, but I hope I will not disappoint you.

I can only insist that all of this is due to your support, even if I am the one that arrange all this would be impossible without you.
For all the people I forgot to mention, please forgive me, you are too much people to remember, for example I now recalled Ryden (OZipper programer), Nethen (Milos admin) or Galaxytool guys.
