</li><li>Added: Private menssage signatures, you can define then in the settings and will appear everytime you start a new message.
</li><li>Added: Autocopy, this one its pretty difficult to explain. When it is activated  whenever you select a piece of text (in any web, in any tab) foxgame will find if there is a string that can be rendered as a coord ([1:1:1], ( 1.1.1), 1/1/1, 1-1-1 or even 1 1 1 are valid coords strings but there are some checks to avoid finding dates). If there is at least one it will store it (if there are more it will store the first) so whenever you go to fleet seend screen it will set the destination to that coords (it will not if you used a direct link from the galaxy).
Again: Select coord text anywhere go to fleet send screen and Voila! the destination is already selected. There is no need to take down numbers anymore.
</li><li>Added: In mines and power plants info screens (the ones you see when you click in the name) you will see the diferences between your actual level and the rest.
</li><li>Redone: DB integration, now you can send solar sistems, stats and spy reports to the three major online BDs for alliances, EspRep, GalaxieTool and Milos (this one is spanish only). Now it can be defined differents DBs to different unis or even different users for the same tool for different unis. Now it is completely flexible. Probably you will find errors with some languages becouse of UTF-8 issues.
</li><li>Fixed: Some private messages being highlighted as Ally messages in U50 ogame.de (bug #14143).
</li><li>Fixed: "Type error: min has no properties" in Mozilla 1.7 due to a programing bug (bug #14107).
</li><li>Fixed: Return time going forever, now it just change to - when the fleet arrives to its destiny.
</li><li>Fixed: Dutch translation now up to date, no more english strings.
</li><li>Known problems unis not updated (I forgot it, tomorrow version 1.4.1 will be out adrressing this) and portuguesse translation of the new features peding I hope I can fix this soon.
