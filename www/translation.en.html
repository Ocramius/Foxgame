<p><strong>How to help with translations:</strong>
Starting from this version I will be using Babelzilla for translations as it should be easier for everyone.
So here it is a How-To use Babelzilla
<ul>
<li>Register yourself on <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org">Babelzilla.org</a>
</li><li>Babelzilla will send you a mail for account activation, just follow the link included.
</li><li>Log in on Babelzilla and in the left menu go to "Web Translation System". 
</li><li>List all extensions and Search for Foxgame 
</li><li>Click on Foxgame name.
</li><li>Now you will see a full list of supported languages, search for your native language (or the one that you want to translate).
</li><li>Once you see it on the right side you will see one of 3 options:
<ol>
<li>Not available: It is a new language you will need to do the full translation.
</li><li>Unknown translator: There is some work done from previous versions or someone that stopped translating.
</li><li>Some text in green: There is already a translator for that language and you have to ask him to give you permission to help (send me a mail and I will try to contact him).
</ol>
</li><li>Once you found the status then click on the language name.
</li><li>At the top you will see "Register me as translator for this extension." click only once.
</li><li>Now you have registered as a translator for that language and you should be able to edit the files (if not, just retry).
</li><li>If in this point you have some problems to register as translator let me know as some people had troubles and needed admin help.
</li><li>There are 3 files "locale/en-US/foxgame/foxgame.dtd", "locale/en-US/foxgame/foxgame.properties" and "locale/en-US/foxgame/contents.rdf", forget the last one and don't bother to touch it.
</li><li>For the other 2 just click on edit and you will see all strings with the text in english and the translated text below (if there is nothing it will be hilighted in light yellow). 
</li><li>Translate what you are capable to translate (it should be easier if you try to find the strings you don´t know in the extension, dtd file strings are in settings panel, properties file are shown inside ogame).
</li><li>When you finish just save the file.
</li><li>If you need a version to test your work then send me a mail (<img src="gmail.png"/>)and I will send it back to you.
</li><li>If you finished with all translations and the locale is ready to be published drop me a mail and I will include it in the next release.
</li><li>And thats all, it is not so difictult, isn't it?  
</li>
</ul>
Thanks for your efforts and happy Ogaming.
